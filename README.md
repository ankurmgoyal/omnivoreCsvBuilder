# Omnivore CSV Builder

A very basic program to pull restaurant POS data into a CSV file. This is being developed as part of an initial test to see if more frequent server performance updates can help restaurant managers.\

As part of this program, I have included the initial stages of a Java library for the Omnivore API. This API will soon be uploaded as a separate opensource project. If you would like to use or contribute to the Java library, please contact me!
